# BayesianCalibrationExamples

Each directory from the repository root is a self-contained programme of scripts and notebooks which explore and demonstrate the features of the [`kohgpjax` package](https://github.com/jamesbriant/KOH-GPJax).

## Calib8 Workflow

The `calib8/` directory contains a modular, configuration-driven workflow for running Bayesian calibration experiments. For detailed instructions on how to define and run experiments, please see the [calib8/README.md](calib8/README.md) file.

## Other Examples

Please only look at the `\presentable` directory. As of 9th May 2025, the other directories will not execute.
