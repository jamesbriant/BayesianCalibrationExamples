Each directory from the repository root is a self-contained programme of scripts and notebooks which explore and demonstrate the features of the [`kohgpjax` package](https://github.com/jamesbriant/KOH-GPJax).

Please only look at the `\presentable` directory. As of 9th May 2025, the other directories will not execute.
